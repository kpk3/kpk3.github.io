Kai archiver is a project I developed during the summer of 2016. The purpose of Kai Archiver is to search through a companies native outlook folders according to user specifications.

Kai archiver is implemented using C# and XML. 

This was the first assignment I was given at Kai Hawaii. When I received it, I had the biggest panic attack of my life because I was being expected to produce a working application for one of the best structural engineering firms in the state in less than three months . . . by myself.
