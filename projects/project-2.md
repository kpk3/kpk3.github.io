Kai archiver is a project I developed during the summer of 2016. The purpose of Kai Archiver is to search through a companies native outlook folders according to user specifications.

Kai archiver is implemented using C# and XML. 

This was the first assignment I was given at Kai Hawaii. When I received it, I had the biggest panic attack of my life because I was being expected to produce a working application for one of the best structural engineering firms in the state in less than three months . . . by myself.

Luckily for me, my TA for one of the ICS courses I took last semester (ICS 211) also work at the same company as an employee! With his guidance (strangely enough he had as little VSTO programming experience as I did) I was able to create a working product in less than a month and by the end of the three months, I had produced a version that's actually better than was asked of me.

The most important thing I learned from this experience is the ever encouraged axiom: adapt to teaching yourself. In that environment where only one person can actually understand your difficulties is an extremely scary position to be in. It's like having PTSD in that respect. Everybody knows you have a problem but nobody is willing take the extra step in helping you.
