Kai archiver is a project I developed during the summer of 2016. The purpose of Kai Archiver is to search through a companies native outlook folders according to user specifications.

Kai archiver is implemented using C# and XML. 

In this project I gained experience using VSTO and programming a Microsoft Add-In.
