Manoa Kine Grindz is a web-app that allows UH students to be able to quickly find what food is currently being served on campus. 

For the most part this project was decent. The main difficulty was merely that our team wasn't really a team. What little we were able to accomplish was purely due to individual contributions produced individually. We never officially met outside of class and we communicated amongst ourselves almost as little.  

This is a screen shot of the calender portion of the app that would have allowed the user to know what products would be available at a given vendor on any given day of the month.

Due to our lack of communication, no specific roles were ever enforced. People did what they could. My contributions were meager. I produced a few of the mock up pages, a bit of the homepage, and a bit of the interface. Other than that it was mostly my teammate, Michael. My other teammate, Chad, as far as I can tell did little to nothing. 

In terms of overall functionality, our project is half formed and no where near to the point where it could be launched.
