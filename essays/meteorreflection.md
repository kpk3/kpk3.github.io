My experience with meteor was like trying to learn chinese with a chinese-to-latin dictionary.

On a more serious note, at least for a first timer, meteor seems extremely hostile towards budding software designers. The tools, albeit powerful, require a great deal of understanding before they actually become useful. What did I find difficult? Meteor itself. Learning web design only using semantic ui was actually fun. The coding itself was simple and straightforward. Every aspect of your code could be quickly pulled up and combed over. With meteor it's as if this cute lovable dog sprouted a second head right out of it's butt and now you need to feed both. You want to implement or un-implement something? Gotta ask meteor before any actual hard coding.

What was easy? Just this past summer I was asked to design a website for an engineering firm that would allow them easy access to the equations and algorithms necessary in the field. The part where I got stuck was when I had to actually keep track of users and log-in. I had absolutely no idea as to how I would safely construct a means of accessing everything that, by the way, would be personalized. Meteor can do this in less than ten lines. 

In short, meteor is obviously what software programmers need at the moment. A means of quickly hard coding with immediate results that even receives input from console. Pretty sweet deal.
