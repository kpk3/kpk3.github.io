The easiest way to ensure that one's code, in this day and age, is of the highest quality is to make it as easy to understand as possible while retaining high efficiency and utility. One example of this is the idea that if one truly understands a fact or concept, then that person would be capable of explaining/teaching it to a novice that has little to no experience regarding it. Richard Feynman had an excellent way of putting this by stating that any and all theories and concepts of physics, no matter how complex or obtuse, could be explained to a first year undergraduate if we had a firm enough understanding of them. In one instance where this wasn't the case, he announced that we simply don't understand that given topic enough.
In relation to coding, this means that "good" code, as far as I'm concerned, should be readable to someone who has only the most basic understanding of programming. To me, if someone were to say that "your code is so simple a ten year old could have written it" is a compliment. What this means is that you have the firmest understanding of how this could should operate, and most importantly appear. Coding isn't (or shouldn't be) a form of art in and of itself. Being cryptic or misdirecting doesn't earn anybody's respect, and may actually inhibit one from landing a job because an employer might think that it's more work to read than it's worth. 
My ICS 212 professor explained this readability standard to us via a brief history of coding. He told as that in the beginning, computer memory was extremely expensive. Much more than it was to hire a programmer. But as hardware became more and more efficient and easier to manufacture, these prices went down and programmers' salary suddenly became liability.
