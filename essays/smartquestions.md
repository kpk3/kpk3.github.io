My relationship with StackOverflow is almost religious. During the summer of 2016, I was asked to produce an add-in for Microsoft Outlook. At the time I had absolutely no experience regarding C# or Microsoft products whatsoever. To put things in perspective, I wasn't even aware of the existence of Visual Studio. After receiving my assignment, the first thing I did was search StackOverflow. Posts like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28446700/outlook-2013-add-in-tutorial-for-beginners">this</a> are what saved me. The irony here is that this question qualifies as mediocre. By definition it's vague. However, for beginners these posts are what set the groudwork for everything.

<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10276323/outlook-addin-goes-straight-to-inactive-application-addins">Here</a> is an example, albeit poorly written in the sense that it's not even posed as a question and there are no capital letters which is something of an eyesore . . . that directly states the problem. No wasted words and very specific. In this instance I would like to point out that I know exactly the issue that the questioner is dealing with and in my experience this isn't the solution. 

The point of all of this, in my opinion, is that I don't think there is a smart or dumb way to ask a question. Or at the very least I don't think that the labels "smart" and "dumb" are appropriate. There's only a right way and a wrong way. However you put it, on StackOverflow, you'll more than likely get a response. Right or wrong is determined by whether you receive the response you wanted.
