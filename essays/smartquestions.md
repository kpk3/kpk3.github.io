My relationship with StackOverflow is almost religious. During the summer of 2016, I was asked to produce an add-in for Microsoft Outlook. At the time I had absolutely no experience regarding C# or Microsoft products whatsoever. To put things in perspective, I wasn't even aware of the existence of Visual Studio. After receiving my assignment, the first thing I did was search StackOverflow. Posts like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28446700/outlook-2013-add-in-tutorial-for-beginners">this</a> are what saved me.
